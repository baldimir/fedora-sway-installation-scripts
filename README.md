# Installation scripts for my Fedora installation

- Install git after the Fedora installation and clone this repository. I use Fedora Minimal install as a base, however in that case you need an ethernet connection to set up network connectivity, because a lot of firmware files are added as part of the "Hardware support" group (which cannot be selected during minimal installation in Fedora 34).
- Prepare wallpapers or extra custom RPMs if needed. 
- Run postinstall.sh.
